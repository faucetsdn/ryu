What's Ryu
==========
Ryu is a component-based software defined networking framework.

Ryu provides software components with well defined API's that make it
easy for developers to create new network management and control
applications. Ryu supports various protocols for managing network
devices, such as OpenFlow, Netconf, OF-config, etc. About OpenFlow,
Ryu supports fully 1.0, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and Nicira Extensions.
