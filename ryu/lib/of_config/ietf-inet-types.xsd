  <xs:simpleType name="port-number">
    <xs:annotation>
      <xs:documentation>
        The port-number type represents a 16-bit port number of an
        Internet transport layer protocol such as UDP, TCP, DCCP, or
        SCTP.  Port numbers are assigned by IANA.  A current list of
        all assignments is available from &lt;http://www.iana.org/&gt;.

        Note that the port number value zero is reserved by IANA.  In
        situations where the value zero does not make sense, it can
        be excluded by subtyping the port-number type.

        In the value set and its semantics, this type is equivalent

  <xs:simpleType name="as-number">
    <xs:annotation>
      <xs:documentation>
        The as-number type represents autonomous system numbers
        which identify an Autonomous System (AS).  An AS is a set
        of routers under a single technical administration, using
        an interior gateway protocol and common metrics to route
        packets within the AS, and using an exterior gateway
        protocol to route packets to other ASs'.  IANA maintains
        the AS number space and has delegated large parts to the
        regional registries.

        Autonomous system numbers were originally limited to 16
        bits.  BGP extensions have enlarged the autonomous system
        number space to 32 bits.  This type therefore uses an uint32
        base type without a range restriction in order to support
        a larger autonomous system number space.

        In the value set and its semantics, this type is equivalent
        to the InetAutonomousSystemNumber textual convention of
        the SMIv2.

        The ipv4-address type represents an IPv4 address in
        dotted-quad notation.  The IPv4 address may include a zone
        index, separated by a % sign.

        The zone index is used to disambiguate identical address
        values.  For link-local addresses, the zone index will
        typically be the interface index number or the name of an
        interface.  If the zone index is not present, the default
        zone of the device will be used.

        The canonical format for the zone index is the numerical

        The ipv6-address type represents an IPv6 address in full,
        mixed, shortened, and shortened-mixed notation.  The IPv6
        address may include a zone index, separated by a % sign.

        The zone index is used to disambiguate identical address
        values.  For link-local addresses, the zone index will
        typically be the interface index number or the name of an
        interface.  If the zone index is not present, the default
        zone of the device will be used.

        The canonical format of IPv6 addresses uses the compressed
        format described in RFC 4291, Section 2.2, item 2 with the
        following additional rules: the :: substitution must be
        applied to the longest sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks
        in an IPv6 address.  If there is a tie, the first sequence
        of all-zero 16-bit chunks is replaced by ::.  Single
        all-zero 16-bit chunks are not compressed.  The canonical
        format uses lowercase characters and leading zeros are
        not allowed.  The canonical format for the zone index is
        the numerical format as described in RFC 4007, Section
        11.2.

  <xs:simpleType name="domain-name">
    <xs:annotation>
      <xs:documentation>
        The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
        name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

        Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
        3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
        2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
        for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
        future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
        domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
        (host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
        that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
        in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
        1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
        schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
        adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

        The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
        to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
        prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
        byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
        notation.

        The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
        type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
        IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
        may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
        and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
        which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
        explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
        resolver.

        Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
        format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
        domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
        3492

      <xs:documentation>
        The uri type represents a Uniform Resource Identifier
        (URI) as defined by STD 66.

        Objects using the uri type MUST be in US-ASCII encoding,
        and MUST be normalized as described by RFC 3986 Sections
        6.2.1, 6.2.2.1, and 6.2.2.2.  All unnecessary
        percent-encoding is removed, and all case-insensitive
        characters are set to lowercase except for hexadecimal
        digits, which are normalized to uppercase as described in
        Section 6.2.2.1.

        The purpose of this normalization is to help provide
        unique URIs.  Note that this normalization is not
        sufficient to provide uniqueness.  Two URIs that are
        textually distinct after this normalization may still be
        equivalent.

        Objects using the uri type may restrict the schemes that
        they permit.  For example, 'data:' and 'urn:' schemes
        might not be appropriate.

        A zero-length URI is not a valid URI.  This can be used to
        express 'URI absent' where required.

        In the value set and its semantics, this type is equivalent
        to the Uri SMIv2 textual convention defined in RFC 5017.
